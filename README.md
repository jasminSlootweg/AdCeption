# Sugarscape Simulation - Implementation Overview

## A. Overview of the Current Implementation State

The current implementation of the **Sugarscape** model simulates a population of **traders** interacting within a landscape that contains two key resources: **sugar** and **spice**. Each trader is designed with specific attributes such as **metabolism**, **vision range**, and **resource preferences**, reflecting a real-world scenario akin to recommendation systems, where traders represent users and their resource preferences simulate ad targeting.

Key features of the simulation:

- **Grid-based Environment**: The environment is represented by a grid where traders move and interact with the available resources.
- **Resource Dynamics**: Sugar and spice are distributed on the grid, and traders can harvest them or trade with others, based on resource availability and individual preferences.
- **Trader Behavior**: Traders are autonomous agents that perform various actions, including moving, harvesting, and trading, all driven by predefined rules.
- **Data Collection**: Key metrics are collected, including:
  - Number of traders
  - Trade volume
  - Price of resources

This model is an evolving system, and the simulation serves as a testbed to observe complex emergent behaviors in a population of resource-harvesting agents.
