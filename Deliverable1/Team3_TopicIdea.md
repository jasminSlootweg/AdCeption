## Section 1: Phenomena of interest.
### Topic Idea

#### AI bots create videos on their own by extracting and modifying already viral videos while the recommendation engine pushes these videos to the public. The first AI creates the videos, and the second AI interaction pushes these videos to the recommended tab. This second AI is the recommendation algorithm that pushes these AI created videos. 
##### -Example, tiktok videos of AI voices narrating a story taken from reddit playing over a video of subway surfers.
##### -Example, taking a podcast clip and playing it over a rug cleaning video
##### -Example, AI generates content by itself to promote a specific agenda such as posting a tweet and other bots create artificial engagement by liking/retweeting, amplifying that agenda.
##### -Example, AI advertising content, pushed by AI recommendation bots
#### Bot battles in video games, allowing for automated battles to occur against other bots without humans having to waste time actually playing the game.
##### -Example, Pokemon TCG pocket allows users to engage in battles against an AI in different tiers like beginner, intermediate, expert etc. The user has the option to select ‘auto battle’ where an AI will play for you, against another AI.
##### -Example, a few video games like SIMS simulate life and keep on playing with itself even when the user is not present.
##### -Example, Fall Guys need a certain number of players to start a game lobby.
#### AI in Manufacturing. In different manufacturing plants around the world, AI is being used to speed up the manufacturing process. Different bots coordinate and communicate with each other to complete their tasks in the most efficient manner.
##### -Example, Tesla uses various robots in their manufacturing of electric cars. Bots are used to weld, paint their cars while other robotic arms hold up these heavy panels, doors. 

### Chosen Phenomena
##### AI creating advertisements, and these advertisements being promoted by AI recommendation tools to target specific groups of people. AI in advertising has changed how businesses create, distribute, and target ads to certain audiences. These ads can be text based, image based, or video based that are tailored to specific audiences based on data analysis. AI recommendations also play a crucial role in the advertising dynamic, ensuring that these ads reach their target audiences. Social media platforms, search engines, and e-commerce sites are littered with ads that use AI algorithms to analyze the behaviors of the users using the platforms. Based on this analysis, an AI system will show the users ads that fit their interests, increase the users engagement and increase the ad click rates.
Key Dynamics
##### Automated Content Generation: Tools like OpenAI’s GPT models that can create personalized content like images, videos, and text. These AI tools allow brands to generate ads quickly.
##### Targeted Advertising: AI driven recommendation systems, like the ones we see on youtube or netflix, or sites that push ads like Meta websites or Google. Targeted advertising is when data is analyzed and user data and predict and influence users purchasing decisions, ensuring ads are only shown to relevant users or users with the highest chance to click.
