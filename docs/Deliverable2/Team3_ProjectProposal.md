## Section 1: Phenomena of interest.

Our phenomena of interest is the relationship between AI creating advertisements, and
these advertisements being promoted by AI recommendation tools to target specific groups of
people. AI in advertising has changed how businesses create, distribute, and target ads to
certain audiences. These ads can be text based, image based, or video based that are tailored
to specific audiences based on data analysis. AI recommendations also play a crucial role in the
advertising dynamic, ensuring that these ads reach their target audiences. Social media
platforms, search engines, and e-commerce sites are littered with ads that use AI algorithms to
analyze the behaviors of the users using the platforms. Based on this analysis, an AI system will
show the users ads that fit their interests, increase the users engagement and increase the ad
click rates. For our project, we want to focus on Instagram advertisement recommendation
systems.

**Artificial Intelligence in Advertising – Advancements, Challenges, and Ethical
Considerations
Summary** _:_ This paper explores the role of AI in advertising, focusing on advancements in
generative AI models that create ad content aligned with brand messaging and audience
preferences. It highlights how machine learning enables personalized content, improving 
engagement and conversion rates. Additionally, the study examines ethical concerns, such as
bias in AI-generated content, transparency issues, and the potential for misinformation. It also
discusses the impact of AI-driven advertising on consumer trust and regulatory considerations.
The paper emphasizes the balance between automation and human oversight in AI-generated
ads, addressing challenges in maintaining authenticity, accountability, and ethical standards in
digital marketing.

**Paper2: AI-Driven Advertising: Automation, Performance Prediction, and Market Impact
Summary:** This article draws attention to how in recent times, AI is reforming the entire digital
advertising space by automatically generating content for highly targeted audiences and
successfully predicting the performance of these advertisements. "AI literally determines if your
[company] ads succeed or fail." (Kaput, 2024) Organizations are now using AI to generate
numerous advertisement variations and gather data regarding market demands and competitor
performances. The article also provides insights on how companies like Vanguard, HOLT CAT
and RedBalloon are using AI advertising tools such as Persado, Emotiva, Pathmatics and many
more to not only launch these data-driven advertising campaigns but also to hire top talents and
budget their marketing costs.

## Section 3: Describe the Core Components of the Simulation

We think that the **Sugarscape Model with Trading** would be the closest simulation to our
chosen phenomena. In this model, traders compete for sugar just like how advertisements
compete for user attention. The economy of this model also emerges through interactions,
just how the media landscape of advertisements needs to change dynamically based on
changing user preferences and product relevances. Sugar would be User Attention, Traders
are the Recommendation bots and Content creation bots, and trading would be the
equivalent of ad bidding and placement optimization.


**3.1 Entities** :

Entity 1: AI Content Generation bots, these create content such as text, images, video, that
are used as advertisements. The goal is to increase engagement by making advertisements
more relevant and appealing.

Entity 2: Recommendation bots, these bots match the generated ads to the users based on
the users behavioral data which indicate user preferences. The goal is to maximize click
rates and engagement.

Entity 3: Humans, these are the consumers of the advertisements who scroll through social
media platforms consuming content. Their goal is to consume engaging and relevant
content, and want to avoid intrusive irrelevant ads.
**3.2 Affordances** : Describe the content and the affordances of the content relevant to your
phenomenon of interest. Affordances refer to action possibilities such as tagging, sharing,
up/down voting, liking, being adjudicated (e.g., as true vs false information; as interesting vs
not interesting, as relevant vs not relevant), eliciting emotional response (valence). Draw on
the mesa examples as analogy to illustrate your content.

● AI content generation bots create advertisements for companies, which in turn is
picked up on by the recommendation bots. These bots create widespread
engagement with these ads by liking them and constantly sharing them across
various platforms, creating a false perception of demand for the product or service
advertised. As a consequence of this heightened demand, more and more people
engage with these advertisements as well, which results in more sales for the
companies.
**3.3 Algorithms** : Describe any algorithms that are relevant to the platform (e.g.,
recommending, content prioritization, etc). Draw on the mesa examples as analogy to
illustrate your content. Each of these sections can be short, such as 50-100 words each.

● The AI content creation bots create advertisements based on how other
advertisements are performing and whatever has the most relevance in the market
at that moment. It surfs through the market to pick out what sort of advertising
people are responding to the most. It creates the advertisement following the trend.
As a consequence, advertisements are fed into the algorithms of people more often
and are prioritized. On top of that, recommendation bots, creating false engagement
helps prioritize these advertisements more and the reach of these advertisements
are further increased.

## Section 4: Simulation Anticipated Outcomes

**4.1 How the Simulation Will Look**
Using the Sugarscape Model with Trading as inspiration, our simulation will visually represent:

● AI Advertisements (Spice), Users (Sugar) are placed in a digital space.

● Ads with high engagement will remain visible, while low-performing ads will disappear.

● Users navigate the space, encountering ads based on recommendation AI decisions.
The simulation will demonstrate

● AI Content Bots adjust ad strategies based on past engagement data, mimicking an
evolutionary learning process.

● Recommendation AI optimizes ad placement dynamically to maximize engagement.

● This optimization will visually show us groups forming in the sugarscape visualization
Anticipated outcomes

● We anticipate being able to observe how users shape ads through engagement, and
how this can lead to possibly creating echo chambers

● We aim to observe how high-engagement ads will persist while low-performing ones will
disappear, leading to dominant ad strategies and potential ad monopolies.

● We aim to observe the changing strategy of the AI recommendation systems
